# Meeting Logs

### 2025-02-11

We have started creating the issues for the project for the first sprint, and we will decide how to separate the tasks and assigning weights to each issue after. Right now we are down a teammate (Charles) due to him being sick, so when he is back we can organize better.

Right now Mohammed is setting up Firebase, Adbullah is going to setup the layout for the home page, Ahmed will start creating the API routes and I will start creating the tests folder and forms.
