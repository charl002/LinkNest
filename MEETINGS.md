# Meeting Logs

### 2025-02-11

We have started creating the issues for the project for the first sprint, and we will decide how to separate the tasks and assigning weights to each issue after. Right now we are down a teammate (Charles) due to him being sick, so when he is back we can organize better.

Right now Mohammed is setting up Firebase, Adbullah is going to setup the layout for the home page, Ahmed will start creating the API routes and I will start creating the tests folder and forms.

Charles created the **GET and POST API** routes for the News API and BlueSKY, and he also cleaned up & assigned the Gitlab issues. He will be working on making the **Posts** appear on the website (for the News and BlueSky).

As of Mohammed, he created the GET and POST API's for the users, and connect it to Firebase. He also implemented unique usernames. He will work on implementing the **profile page**.

Ahmed implemented Google Auth and is now working on users posting on the application. -_--------

I fixed the Jest testings since it was causing issues for the pipeline. I also added the chatting feature, but sonme bugs are still there so I need to fix them before I merge to **staging**. I will work next on fixing the chatting and implementing the connection between users.

Adbullah worked on the Gitlab CI and the layout -----_---
