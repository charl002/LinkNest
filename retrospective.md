# RETROSPECTIVE 1:
    Thiha:
    Understanding how to start our chatting server at the same time as the next server was a bit complicated at first.
    Fixing the artifact went well and helped us finally get Azure Deployment working.
    I think we should improve the size of our artifact, our performance and add more comments to our code.

    Charles:
    Me and Abdullah were trying to fix weird bugs that only happen the first time the app loads, but we couldn't find the reason why, so we'll keep working on that.
    Creating the APIs to display posts on our feed went well, it looks awesome and almost feels like a real Social Media Website!
    I also think we should improve the size of our artifact, our performance and add more comments to our code.

    Abdullah:
    Just like Charles said, we had some issues with weird bugs.
    Creating the layout for our website went well, and it looks great.
    I think the same as my teammates for what we can do next sprint.

    Mohammad:
    I had an issue related to handling promises with typescript when creating the profile page, 
    which was causing a build error and it took me 3 days to find a solution from someone that had the same issue as me.
    Handling new users and setting up their account was something that went well for me.
    Same thing for next sprint as the others.

    Ahmed:
    creating Google authentication, which was a little tricky, as well as making the post API that adds posts to the userâ€™s feed.
    What went well was implementing the friend acceptance feature, which integrates with the friend request system Thiha created.
    Something to change would be the performance of our application since it is a little slow.
